# Product Overview

## Product Description

Kiro is a spec-driven development framework built on Claude Code that implements Japanese-style structured development workflows. It provides systematic phases for requirements gathering, design, task management, and implementation using AI-powered slash commands and specialized agents.

## Core Features

- **Phase-based Development Workflow**: Structured 3-phase approach (Requirements → Design → Tasks → Implementation)
- **Intelligent Steering System**: Project-wide guidance through contextual steering documents
- **Specialized AI Agents**: Research specialist, architecture reviewer, code quality reviewer, security reviewer, and task implementer
- **Interactive Approval Process**: Human-in-the-loop confirmation at each development phase
- **Multi-language Support**: Bilingual operation (English thinking, Japanese responses)
- **Spec-driven Architecture**: Formal specification documents guide all development
- **Claude Code Integration**: Native slash commands and hooks for seamless AI development
